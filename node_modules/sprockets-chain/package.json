  "readme": "# SprocketsChain\n\n`SprocketsChain` is a small node.js utility that parses Sprockets require directives and returns the dependency chain\nfor a JavaScript bundle, which is a list of the file paths that make the bundle, ordered so that each file is preceded\nby all its dependencies.\n\n## Why\n\nSprockets is very nice for managing assets and their dependencies in a Ruby project. When testing JavaScript though,\nprecompiling and bundling assets is slow and not really needed. It is more efficient to just require the separate\nJavaScript/CoffeeScript source files in the correct order. `SprocketsChain` parses the require directives and provides\nyou with the correct ordered list of absolute file paths. This helps setting up a JavaScript test suite that is fast and\ncompletely independent from the Ruby application environment.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar SprocketsChain = require(\"sprockets-chain\");\n\nvar sc = new SprocketsChain();\n\n// Append paths to the list of load paths\nsc.appendPath(\"app/assets/javascripts\");\nsc.appendPath(\"lib/assets/javascripts\");\nsc.appendPath(\"vendor/assets/javascripts\");\n\n// If necessary, append extensions (defaults are \".js\", \".coffee\")\nsc.appendExtensions(\".ejs\", \".eco\");\n\n// Get ordered array of individual absolute file paths that compose the\n// `application.js` bundle\nvar chain = sc.depChain(\"application.js\");\n```\n\n## Supported Sprockets directives\n\nThe following Sprockets directive are supported: `require`, `require_self`, `require_directory`, `require_tree`\nand `include`\n\n## MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Luca Ongaro\n\nMIT License\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
